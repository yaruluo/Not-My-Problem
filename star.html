      <p>Ok, so none of these products are real. They're meant to draw attention to real problems that the world faces, as you have probably realized.</p>
      <p>Most people have never seen a full, starry night sky, and this is the form of pollution that most people have forgotten: light pollution. Light pollution adds carbon emissions and interferes with animal migration, and continuously impacts wildlife, energy sources, and human health, and yet we routinely dump chemical trash into the atmosphere</p>
      <p>However, there are things that you can do to prevent this product from becoming real.</p>
      <ol type="1">

Motion sensitive switches light up porches only when you need to move around, and they'll pay for themselves in a short time.</li>
