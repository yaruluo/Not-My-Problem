      <h2>What We Are</h2>
      Ocean pollution, climate change, and other environmental impacts have become increasingly difficult to remove. This website is a satirical analysis of what our world could become if our current environmental ruin continues unresolved, because we’ve realized that it’s hard to actually comprehend what the effect of plastic pollution and damage our oceans face. Satire is a technique used by writers to try to improve humanity by criticizing its wickedness, and gains user interest through its entertainment. We tried to create a non-traditional and engaging way for people to realize what's happening in the world and motivate them to change bad habits that harm the environment.
      <h2>What's Next?</h2>
      Climate change is real whether some world leaders believe it or not. The steps we can take as individuals are limited, but as a whole, the sky's the limit. Human mistreatment has endangered the world around us, so it is only right that we take action to return Mother Nature to her glory days. We could continue to build on this project by partnering with the federal police to more heavily enforce the Clean Water Act and preserve our oceans and the life in it. On a chemical level, air pollution has played a major role in the rapid progression of global warming. Although Earth’s three trillion trees could attempt to combat our ozone depletion, deforestation has been causing our forests to shut down.
<br><br>
By partnering with influential, environmentally aware manufacturers such as Georgia-Pacific Corp and Stora Enso, we could use this platform to expose and confront corporate environmental abuse. We could further improve this by partnering with the products that we list to get a commision of the sales, which would then be donated to different organizations.
<br><br>
We hope that this project continues to encourages people to be more optimistic about the future health of Earth by shifting attitudes about concern for the natural world and the damage that humans are doing to the planet.

      This floating heap of trash is the size of Russia! If you’re a fan of Mean Girls, be sure to visit these huge piles of plastic. Unlike my last relationship, plastic is one of the most durable materials on earth, with a potential lifespan of centuries.

      Half the coral reef is still visible, so be sure to visit it while you still can! You’ve seen the tide pod and bleach memes, but now you can even partake in the annual coral bleaching events this summer when water is too warm and corals expel the algae living in their tissues, causing the coral to turn completely white. Student discounts are available.

      <div class="lastLine">
      This one’s for all you people who hate adorable animals. Reindeer and other animals are dying by the thousands by starvation because of increases in rain, causing abnormally thick layers of snow and ice in their habitat, making it impossible for them to access the vegetation on which they survive. As a result, most of Siberia’s animal species and communities that rely on them face a serious threat of climate change, so more living space for us!
