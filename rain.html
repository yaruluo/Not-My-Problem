      <p>Ok, so none of these products are real. They're meant to draw attention to real problems that the world faces, as you have probably realized.</p>
      <p>Acid rain refers to a mixture of deposited material, both wet and dry, coming from the atmosphere containing more than normal amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids. Simply put, it means rain that is acidic in nature due to the presence of certain pollutants in the air due to cars and industrial processes. </p>
      <p>However, there are things that you can do to prevent this product from becoming real.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Conserve energy by turning off electronics when you're not using them. Check out the link for our star projector for more ways to save!</li>
        <br><li>Minimize miles on cars and trucks by using public transportation or carpooling. Walking and biking are also great for your health.</li>
        <br><li>Use renewable sources of energy such as solar, wind, and water energy. Solar powered heating systems and battery-powered cars are becoming cheaper and more common in many households.</li>
