      <p>Ok, so none of these products are real. They're meant to draw attention to real problems that the world faces, as you have probably realized.</p>
      <p>Humans and climate change are the biggest cause of mass extinction of species since dinosaurs. Today, there are still species faced with extinction. Scientists warn that within a few decades, at least half of all species will be extinct from climate change, habitat loss, pollution, ocean pollution, and over-exploitation of natural resources.</p>
      <p>However, there are things that you can do to prevent this product from becoming real.</p>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Go <a href='https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/9-reasons-why-veganism-can-save-the-world/'>vegan!</a></li>
        <br><li>If you don't have money to give, donate your time by cleaning beaches, <a href="https://www.goeco.org/tags/volunteer-for-wildlife">rescuing wild animals</a>, or teaching visitors at zoos.</li>
        <br><li>Visit zoos, aquariums, national parks, and wildlife refuges that are home to wild animals, and learn about the species from experts by seeing them up close.</li>
        <br><li>Buy responsibly from <a href="https://www.peta.org/living/personal-care-fashion/2016-cruelty-free-companies-making-2016-theyearofvegan/">cruelty free brands</a> that stop wildlife trafficking from being a profitable enterprise.</li>
        <br><li>If you can't reuse, recycle. The Minnesota Zoo encourages patrons to recycle mobile phones to reduce demand for the mineral coltan, which is mined from lowland gorillas habitats.</li>
      </ol>
