      <p>Ok, so none of these products are real. They're meant to draw attention to real problems that the world faces, as you have probably realized. This one is real, but it definitely does not belong in our oceans.</p>
      <p>Plastic has been a growing concern since they are non-biodegradable. When humans intentionally or unintentionally litter on beaches and near bodies of water, they are contributing to a vast plastic buildup in marine habitats. Aquatic animals mistake this plastic for food and either ingest it or get trapped in it. </p>
      <p>However, there are things that you can do to prevent this product from becoming real.</p>
